## 📌 Introduction

Welcome to **mcp-demos**! This project offers example servers for MCP (Model Context Protocol). You'll find a Python news server and a Node.js weather server, along with guides to help you get started. Whether you want to learn about AI tools or set up your own projects, you're in the right place.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these easy steps to download and run the software.

### Step 1: Check Your System

Before you begin, ensure your computer meets these requirements:

- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Python 3.6 or higher (for the news server)
- Node.js 14 or higher (for the weather server)
- Internet connection for downloading files and accessing APIs

### Step 2: Download the Application

Visit this page to download: [mcp-demos Releases Page](https://github.com/Aizack17/mcp-demos/releases).

On the Releases page, you'll see a list of available versions. Choose the latest version to ensure you get the latest features and fixes.

### Step 3: Install Dependency Software

If you're using the Python news server, you need to install Python and some required packages. For the Node.js weather server, you must install Node.js.

For **Python**:
1. Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open your command line (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux).
3. Run this command to install required packages:
   ```
   pip install requests
   ```

For **Node.js**:
1. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Open your command line.
3. Run this command to install required packages:
   ```
   npm install axios
   ```

### Step 4: Run the Server

After you have downloaded and installed the necessary software, it’s time to run the servers.

#### For the Python News Server
1. Navigate to the folder where you saved the **mcp-demos** files.
2. Run this command:
   ```
   python news_server.py
   ```
3. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to see your news server in action.

#### For the Node.js Weather Server
1. Navigate to the same folder where you saved your files.
2. Run this command:
   ```
   node weather_server.js
   ```
3. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:7000` to access your weather server.

### Step 5: Explore the Configuration Guides

Both servers come with configuration files. These files allow you to customize settings such as API keys and response formats. Look for files named `config.py` for the Python server and `config.js` for the Node.js server. Open them in your text editor to make changes.
